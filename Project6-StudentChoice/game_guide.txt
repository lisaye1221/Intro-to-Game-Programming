Riddle Explanation(Spoiler Alert)

1. First we see direct confliction between blue and red's statement. 
   Notice that red must be lying, or else blue and red'statement will become a paradox.

2. Knowing that red is lying automatically tells us that blue is telling the truth.

3. Since red is lying, either yellow or blue has to be lying. Since we already found out blue
   is telling the truth, we can conclude that yellow is lying. This matches yellow's statement. 

4. Since we conclude yellow is lying, we can conclude that green is telling the truth.

5. Since we conclude green is telling the truth, we can conclude purple is lying.

6. The final answer is green and blue, they are the two slimes that are telling the truth.
