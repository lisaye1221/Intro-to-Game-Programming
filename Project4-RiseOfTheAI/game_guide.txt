Capture the bunnies before the time runs out

On Level 1: 

This bunny will start to run away if you get too close to it.
Chase it!

On Level 2: 

The bunny will copy your movement and seem to move as fast as you.
But it will only do so if you're on the second level
...
Try to get it directly under a ladder so you can loop around, drop down, and surprise it.

On Level 3: 

These two bunnies will jump up to the 4th level when they see you.
Be careful of which way they are looking. It changes from time to time.
