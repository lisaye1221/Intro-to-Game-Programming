Day and Night Lite

In this platformer, your enemies are not always your enemies. 
As day switch to night and vice versa, friends become enemies and enemies become friends.
The switch is random so watch out!

If you haven't figured out yet: 
Bunny- day:friend, night:enemy
Fish- day:enemy, night:friend


Simpler and Platformer version of my old game Day and Night(Hence the addition of "Lite" in the Title).
